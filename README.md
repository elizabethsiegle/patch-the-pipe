# patch-the-pipe
You are here because you are feeling unwelcome in tech and thinking of leaving or you feel deeply that tech should be for everyone and want to keep people from leaving. Either way, you are on the right place. Being in tech can be great, from the financial benefits to the flexibility of work hours. We get to solve complex problems and make new things. 

However, it can be extremely toxic, especially to those of underrepresented identities. It can be easy to look around and say, I don’t want to put up with this, I’m out.  If you’re the only one who looks like you or acts like you in your workplace, it can be extremely isolating. You are passed up for promotions and choice projects. You are paid less and get less credit. It can be difficult to be yourself but still “fit in”. Patch the pipe is here to help you get what you need to stay and thrive in tech. We want to help make the tech community one we want to be in 5, 10, 15 years from now.

How’s does Patch the Pipe work?

If you’re thinking of leaving...

What do you need? A mentor? Code reviews? A new job? Strategies to ask for a raise? Information about what it’s like at other companies? Career path ideas? First step is to look through the repo, maybe what you need is already answered. If it hasn’t or it’s a more specific vs general question (ie, can someone look a my resume), submit an issue! One of our volunteers will get back to you ASAP.

If you want help….

Go through the issues. Answer a question! If you feel like the answer could help others, submit a pull request to add it to our knowledge base.
